- Data-driven feature optimization
- Open-source projects that improve developer experience
- AI-assisted tools and automation

## I’m currently learning:
- Django and REST API development
- SQL for data manipulation and analytics
- A/B testing concepts and statistical evaluation

## I’m looking to collaborate on:
